\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he rapid} development and expansion of the internet has introduced new ways for individuals to express their opinions and disseminate their views. Online reviews have become a hugely important source of information for consumers. They play an important role in determining whether a person is satisfied with a product or service. Online reviews provide a huge amount of data on consumer preferences. 

This paper will focus on Twitter, a microblogging social media site, where users can post short blocks of text of no more than 280 characters. Twitter currently has ~126 million people who use the site daily, with over 500 million tweets posted per day \cite{Twitter2019}. These tweets can often take the form of a review and can give insight into consumers' opinions on the entities with which they interact. With millions of tweets being posted every day, Twitter has a huge potential source of underutilised reviews.

Traditional online review sites include websites like TripAdvisor, Foursquare and Yelp. Often these sites have a dedicated area for feedback and encourage users to leave reviews of their hotels, restaurants or products. In our opinion, this method of obtaining reviews can sometimes result in more forced, manufactured, less reliable reviews. It is our contention that users tend to post their genuine feelings more spontaneously and frequently to Twitter. Users often wouldn't consider their posts to be a 'review' in the formal sense of the word and not in the same way they would consider a review left in the dedicated feedback area of another website.

In this paper, we will investigate to what extent Twitter can provide a suitable source of online reviews that can be used effectively in the generation of recommendations in a recommender system. We will explore methods of classifying review-like tweets, identifying the sentiment of the reviews and the effect of using this data in a recommender system. The project will focus on tweets that mention or discuss hotels in the Dublin area.

Twitter data has a different format to standard long-form text and needs to be treated differently. Tweets are short with a maximum of 280 characters, which has led to the use of particular characteristic features. Tweets are generally very informal, using casual language and slang. They contain features like hashtags, emojis, Twitter handles, URLs, images, videos and gifs, which don't occur in standard text. The short length and non-standard features can create a challenge for standard text classification algorithms and standard machine learning feature representations. 

This paper is organised as follows: Section II presents a review of the literature relating to this project. Section III describes the design and methodology of the project. It outlines how the data was collected, filtered, processed, and annotated. It also describes the classification techniques used, the sentiment analysis tool used and how the sentiment scores produced were applied to the recommender system CoRE \cite{core2019}. Section IV presents an evaluation and discussion of the results of this research. Finally, Section V gives our conclusions and future works.
